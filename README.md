# ACNH Birthday Directory

This mid-mod is frontend focused and for practicing React skills.

### Minimum Project Requirements

- There should be at least 4-5 functional components
- There should be at least 3 or more pages (separate routes)
- The Application must make use of React Router (`npm install react-router-dom`)
- Uses at least one external API
- Prop passing of some sort
- Has README.md file at the root of repository that clearly documents the purpose of the project, the target end user, and includes a link to the deployed version of the project
- Must have a repository and make regular commits (at least 10 total)
- Must be deployed (a good option is Netlify.)

### Stretch Goals:

- Manage at least some part of state with the useReducer and useContext hooks (together) or Redux. (`npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux`)
- Use Local Storage to store some of your application data in the browser
- Install axios (`npm install axios`) and use it to read external APIs
- Use a CSS Framework (like Bootstrap) to style part of your application

## Motivations

I choose this project idea due to love of video games, like Animal Crossing, and wanting to pick a fun topic. Also the ease of access to the information. I wanted to pick an API that was relatively simple to understand.

This project is for the Animal Crossing Lovers like myself.

## Screenshots

I used Miro to help whiteboard an idea for the layout.

## Tech Stack

**Client:** React, Bulma, SCSS, SASS, Font Awesome

**Server:** Node

## Lessons Learned

I learned that I need a lot more practice with the fundamentals of JavaScript. This project required the use of a lot of array methods like map, find, and filter. I also used a lot of string methods such as includes and split.

This project really challenged the way I think about problem solving and helped me to sharpen my debugging skills.

Some challenges I faced was the simplistic nature of the API. There were no built in functions to search or filter the information so I had to come up with that myself. Thinking through that process was difficult but a lot of fun.

Also incorporating Bulma and SASS in the project was difficult. Bulma is a newer css framework so the documentation is not as detailed, in addition to support and troubleshooting tips. There was a lot of trial and error but I ultimately enjoyed it. I choose Bulma because of the fact it was newer.

I was initially going to try TailWind CSS but after testing it out, it was overwhelming with the amount features, and I did not like how much code was in my files. Bulma provides a similar experience, but paired down. I will say I like the simplicity of Bulma, however for this project, more customization would have been preferable.

## Roadmap

- Additional styling (try with bootstrap?)

- Add more information about villagers

- Refactor code to simplify

- Try axios

- Rework the day page

- condense search forms into one with dropdown
